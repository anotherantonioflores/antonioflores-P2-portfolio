**Ricardo Antonio Flores III, CSM**

I am a passionate problem solver and leader. Throughout my academic and professional career, I have sought to lead by example, go above and beyond, and push the boundaries of success. Whether I'm testing different machine learning models, leading a team of developers on an Agile project, or continuing to expand my knowledge through constant learning, I will always give 100%.

With a background in public speaking, as well as a wealth of diverse leadership experiences, I bring an adaptable set of skills that allow me to perform at my best no matter the circumstance. Currently, I am seeking to bring these skills into the world of Data Analytics. I want to be a leader in the world of Data who brings up those around me while communicating clearly to my stakeholders.
